This project is one of the freest project of your first year. Create your own RPG.
Your main challenge for this game will be to create a complete product using everything that you and your team know.

Your game must follow the following rules :

- Having a pleasant user interface.
- Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, ...)
- Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal.
- Create a game with a beginning and an end.

```text
You should think and look for information about how to create a simple yet entertaining
RPG.
```

```text
The size of your repository (including the assets) must be as small as possible.
Think of the format and the encoding of your resource files (sounds, music, images,..).
An average maximal size might be 30MB, all included.
Any repository exceeding this limit might not be evaluated at all.
